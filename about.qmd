The Alaska Electrical Trends Web Book has been produced by the Alaska Center for Energy and Power ([ACEP](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/)) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks ([UAF](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/index.php)). It is designed to be interactive and dynamically updated when new data becomes available. This makes it a fundamental departure from its ancestor, the _Alaska Energy Statistics Report_.

## Historical Timeline of Prior Reports
- Before 1985: federal Alaska Power Administration published Alaska Electric Power Statistics report (AEPS)
- 1985: Alaska Energy Authority (AEA, formerly Alaska Power Authority) begins gathering statistical data and publishing annual report
- 1988: AEPS report becomes combined effort of the Alaska Systems Coordinating Council (ASCC) and AEA
- 1993: AEPS becomes joint effort of the ASCC and the Alaska Department of Community and Regional Affairs, Division of Energy
- 1995 - 2003: No reports published
- 2003: the Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) prepare a report with funding from AEA, the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), and the Denali Commission
- 2008 - 2012: ISER prepares Alaska Energy Statistics updates with funding from AEA
- 2013: AEA prepares Excel workbook with updated data, but no report

## Technical Details

The book is formatted using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. 

The markdown files that make up the book reside in a GitHub repo that is publicly available. Errors can be flagged using GitHub issues where they can be tracked and addressed by the DCM team.

The book also integrates R code for data processing and figure generation. When data files are updated, triggering the render will update the figures automatically.
