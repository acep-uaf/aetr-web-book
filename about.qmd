The Alaska Electrical Trends web book has been produced by the Alaska Center for Energy and Power ([ACEP](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/)) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks ([UAF](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/index.php)). It is a collaboration between data scientists, researchers, and policy experts.

## Data and Cyberinfrastructure Management (DCM) Team

ACEP's DCM Team <!-- (add a link when it becomes available) -->  includes software developers, mathematicians, spatial analysts, economists, open science enthusiasts, and experts in information security and the deployment of computer infrastructure. Together, DCM creates stable and secure pipelines for data from collection to publication. These DCM members generated figures, wrote text, and coded this web book:

# Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge the federal and Alaska state agencies that make their reports and data publicly accessible. Without this openness, this report would not be possible. We would also like to thank the utilities who responded directly when we had questions. A full list of these organizations has been complied in our [Methods Section](methods.qmd).
