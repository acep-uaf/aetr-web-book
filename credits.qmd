The Alaska Electrical Trends web book has been produced by the Alaska Center for Energy and Power ([ACEP](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/)) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks ([UAF](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/index.php)). It is a collaboration between data scientists, researchers, and policy experts.

## Data and Cyberinfrastructure Management (DCM) Team {#sec-contacts}

ACEP's DCM Team <!-- (add a link when it becomes available) -->  includes software developers, mathematicians, spatial analysts, economists, open science enthusiasts, and experts in information security and the deployment of computer infrastructure. Together, DCM creates stable and secure pipelines for data from collection to publication. These DCM members generated figures, wrote text, and coded this web book:

Data used in the energy workbooks comes from a variety of sources and partners, but special thanks to the Alaska Energy Authority for partnering with the team to get the base line power cost equalization datasets made available. Without this openness, this report would not be possible. We would also like to thank the utilities who responded directly when we had questions. A full list of these organizations has been complied in our [Methods Section](methods.qmd).
