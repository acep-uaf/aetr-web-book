## Acknowledgements

Funding support for this team was provided by leveraging support from multiple partners that include: 

- Office of Naval Research's ([ONR](https://www.onr.navy.mil/)) Alaska Regional Collaboration for Technology Innovation and Commercialization ([ARCTIC](https://thearcticprogram.net/about/)) program 
- [Denali Commission](https://www.denali.gov)
- State of Alaska
- Alaska Center for Energy and Power ([ACEP](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/)) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks ([UAF](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/index.php))
- Institute of Social and Economic Research ([ISER](https://iseralaska.org)) at the University of Alaska Anchorage ([UAA](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu))

Data used in the energy workbooks comes from a variety of sources and partners, but special thanks to the Alaska Energy Authority for partnering with the team to make the base line power cost equalization datasets available. Without this openness, this report would not be possible. We would also like to thank the utilities who responded directly when we had questions. A full list of these organizations has been complied in @sec-sources.

The Alaska Electrical Trends web book has been produced by the Alaska Center for Energy and Power ([ACEP](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/)) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks ([UAF](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/index.php)). It is a collaboration between data scientists, researchers, and policy experts.
