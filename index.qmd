## Welcome  {#welcome .unnumbered}

This interactive report summarizes federal, state, and utility electricity data in the form of a web book. It provides an overview of electricity capacity, generation, consumption, and price trends from 2011 to 2021. A comprehensive report highlighting these trends has not been produced for the state of Alaska since the 2013 _Alaska Energy Statistics Report_.

This web book is designed as 'best available' document for the 2011-2021 energy trends data and reports. This website will be updated when updates to the underlying 2011-2021 data or fixes become available. Future year trends reports will be tackled in a different context and reporting structure.

Please explore the data using the chapter navigation links in the left sidebar and the section navigation links in the right sidebar. Additional chapters include:

- About the Report: an historical timeline of previous Alaskan energy reports and technical details on this version.
- About the Team: credits and acknowledgments for the people and funding sources that contributed to this report.
- Methods: a description of data sources, the Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program, and the geographic regions used for analysis.
