## Welcome  {#welcome}

This report summarizes federal, state, and utility data to provide an overview of electricity capacity, generation, consumption, and price trends from 2011 to 2021. A comprehensive report highlighting these trends has not been produced for the state of Alaska since the 2013 Alaska Energy Statistics Report.

The book has been designed to be a living document that will be updated as more data becomes available.
