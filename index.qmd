## Welcome  {#welcome}

This interactive report summarizes federal, state, and utility electricity data in the form of a web book. It provides an overview of electricity capacity, generation, consumption, and price trends from 2011 to 2021. A comprehensive report highlighting these trends has not been produced for the state of Alaska since the 2013 _Alaska Energy Statistics Report_.

The book has been designed to be a living document that will be updated as more data becomes available. Please explore the data using the chapter navigation links in the left sidebar and the section navigation links in the right sidebar. Additional chapters include:

- About the Report: an historical timeline of previous Alaskan energy reports and technical details on this version.
- About the Team: credits and acknowledgments for the people and funding sources that contributed to this report.
- Methods: a description of data sources, the Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program, and the geographic regions used for analysis.
