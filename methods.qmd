# Data Sources
The data in this report was collected from a variety of sources and are listed below. Many electric utilities throughout the state are not required to submit annual reports to the federal government due to their size and/or number of customers. Therefore, our data sources encompass federal, state, commercial, and local filings as well as direct communications with utilities and state program managers. Each section of the report pulls data from a variety of these sources. The data was downloaded directly from the original source and concatenated to develop a dataset for this report. In some cases, a single observation is derived from multiple sources due to reporting limitations. 

Below are relevant sources of data for the report.

## Compilation

An Alaska engineering firm, [DOWL](https://www.dowl.com/), was hired to do the preliminary compilation of data and develop the workbooks supporting this report.  Since  this data comes from various sources, there is potential for errors in the compilation of the workbooks. Any discrepancies or noted errors should be reported to a member of the DCM Team listed on the [About Page](about.qmd).

# Power Cost Equalization (PCE)

Alaska is famous for wide expanses of rugged terrain. Towns are often extremely distant from one another, or are separated by inaccessible mountains and glaciers. The utility landscape of Alaska resembles a sea of islands, very different from the interconnected grids of the contiguous United States. 

In total, Alaska contains over 100 separate utilities, many of which serve a single small community. Most rely on diesel generators connected to huge fuel tanks, which receive a barge shipment of fuel in the summer that must last through the winter. If the town runs out of fuel during winter months, additional fuel has to be flown in at extreme expense. Predictably, electricity in these remote towns is prohibitively expensive. Some rural towns pay 3 to 5 times the rates of urban Alaska. 

Urban Alaska has greatly benefited from large state-subsidized energy projects, such as the Bradley Lake Hydroelectric Project, the Four Dam Pool Projects, and the Alaska Intertie. In an effort to confer similar benefits to rural Alaska, the state of Alaska developed the Power Cost Equalization Program (PCE).

The PCE program reimburses rural utilities for credits that have been provided to eligible customers. Eligibility is limited to residential customers and community facilities. The subsidy applies to the first 750 kWh per month of residential consumption. Community facilities are subsidized up to the first 70 kWh per month per resident. The program is administered by the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) and the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA).

# Regional Summaries

For the purpose of energy planning, AEA has defined [eleven energy regions](https://dcra-cdo-dcced.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/edb3e790ea4b40579f29e925afc061c5_0/explore?showTable=true) for the State of Alaska. Previous versions of the _Alaska Electric Energy Statistics_ reports presented data summarized by those regions. In order to provide visualizations that are easier to understand, we have condensed these eleven regions into three major energy regions: Coastal, Railbelt, and Rural Remote. 

We note that the Coastal and Rural Remote regions include mixtures of power cost equalization (PCE) and non-PCE eligible communities. The Coastal region includes Copper River/Chugach and incorporates all communities served by Copper Valley Electric Association. PCE communities are largely dependent on diesel generation.

[^1]: PCE assistance is applied to only the first 750 kWh per month of residential consumption, and also to community facilities consumption up to the equivalent of 70 kWh per month for each person.
