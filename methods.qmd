Report currently has data caveats spread throughout the text as footnotes. I think that information should be gathered together here.
- links back to this information here can then be added to the other pages (instead of footnotes?)


## Data Sources

Data discussed in this report come from 2 main sources... (Are there any other data sources?)

### Energy Information Authority (EIA)

what is this?  Why isn't a source for all data? (i.e. reporting to EIA is not required for Alaskan utilities)
- list of forms?  which ones actually used?
- how did Neil get these

### Power Cost Equalization

what is this program? why utilities report here?  why is it fiscal year?  why might data be missing?
- extracted from AEA "accounting system"
- communities vs utilities

Assume no one knows what a PCE is.  Maybe think of Catalyst while write this. Show what we have to offer and why Alaska is different/special.

### Workbooks (maybe call this something else)

By which I mean Neil's cross referencing between the 2 sources
- will we distribute these? If so, link.  If not, then say why (nicely!)
- how to cross reference between the AEA and EIA?  This is cool!
- differences between the 2 data sets

## Data Processing and Aggregations

- calendar vs fiscal year
- error corrections (at what stage did this happen?)
- Jesse's big files - link to these, right?


## Regional Summaries

How were regions defined previously? Why didn't we just copy that?

In this report, we categorize the state into three separate energy regions, each being a collection of various Alaska Energy Authority (AEA) energy regions. These regions are herein known as the Coastal Region (Southeast, Kodiak, Chugach/Copper River), the Railbelt, and rural remote communities (all other AEA energy regions).

## Future plans

- database
- API / queries
- expose Neil's transmission lines thing
