## General Overview

Utilities in Alaska serve multiple customers, namely residential, commercial, industrial, government/municipal, and community customer classes. Each customer class experiences a different set of costs such as per kWh charge as well as monthly customer charges. In this section, we aim to highlight trends in electricity prices for the residential, commercial, and industrial customer classes across the Coastal, Railbelt, and Rural Remote regions. We again restrict the data years in this section to 2011 to 2019 due to concerns with data validity for 2020-21.  

In rural areas, many communities are eligible to participate in the PCE program. It is important to note that the prices presented here reflect the post-PCE adjustment and are annualized averages based on the calendar year. Yearly average effective rates listed here reflect the calendar year and not the fiscal year, which will make them different from those reported in the AEAâ€™s annual reports. We report the average revenue per kWh for each customer class.  

The following figure shows the average price across all customer classes and regions in the state. All prices in this section have been adjusted for inflation over time to 2021 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items in urban Alaska (BLS CUUSA427SA0). To our knowledge, there is no CPI that properly accounts for price changes over time in rural Alaska. However, the general trend shows that customer account-weighted prices have been relatively stagnant across all regions of the state.

## Regional Overview
While the average prices can show overall trends, there is nuance to electricity prices throughout the different regions of the state and various classes of electricity customers. To provide an example of this, we show the variation in electricity prices for the residential customer class across regions and years in the figure below.  

Due to the wide range of electricity prices in Alaska, it is difficult to accurately summarize the data. Because of this, we determined that averages were best calculated using a customer account weighted average. Population is roughly correlated to price, with small communities experiencing higher rates than larger communities. The average number of customer accounts for the year was used to calculate the weighted arithmetic mean price for each year and region.

## Coastal

The following figure shows the average price of electricity in the Coastal region for each customer class and year. Between 2011 and 2019, the region experienced decreasing prices for Commercial and Other customers, while Residential customers have seen a slight increase in price.  

The average price of electricity for Residential customers in the Coastal region rose 6% from $0.17/kWh in 2011 to $0.18/kWh in 2019. The average price of electricity for Commercial customers in the Coastal region fell 5% from $0.21/kWh in 2011 to $0.20/kWh in 2019. Finally, the average price of electricity for Other customers in the Coastal region fell 15% from $0.40/kWh in 2011 to $0.34/kWh in 2019.
Residential customers in the Coastal region saw increases in electricity while commercial and other customers saw decreases. However, the residential customer class continues to pay the lowest per kWh in the region due to a combination of low prices in high population areas and PCE subsidies in eligible communities.

## Railbelt

The following figure shows the average price of electricity in the Railbelt region for each customer class and each year of the report. Between 2011 and 2019, Other customers saw a large decrease in price, followed by a gradual increase. Residential and Commercial customers experienced slight decreases in price until 2013 when prices reversed and rose dramatically.  

The average price of electricity for Residential customers in the Railbelt rose 26% from $0.19/kWh in 2011 to $0.24/kWh in 2019. The average price of electricity for Commercial customers in the Railbelt rose 18% from $0.17/kWh in 2011 to $0.20/kWh in 2019. Finally, the average price of electricity for Other customers in the Railbelt fell 6% from $0.19/kWh in 2011 to $0.18/kWh in 2019.
This region differs significantly from the Coastal and Rural Remote regions in that residential customers pay more for electricity than the Commercial or Other customer classes.
