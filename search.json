In contrast, this report uses monthly data provided by AEA for PCE-related communities and utilities to compile calendar year reports to align with EIA data.\nThe Alaska Energy Statistics workbooks that were used as detailed references in the development of this report are publicly available for data years 2014 through 2021 through the ACEP website.",

These regions are herein known as the Coastal Region (Southeast, Kodiak, Chugach/Copper River), the Railbelt, and rural remote communities (all other AEA energy regions).\nRegarding electricity generation capacity across the state, we examine large increases in fossil fuel consuming turbines and reciprocating internal combustion engines as well as nominal increases in renewable-sourced capacity (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, etc.). Capacity across the state has increased XX MW, with XX% of that capacity increase being in the Railbelt, XX% being in rural and remote communities, and XX% being in the coastal energy region.",
