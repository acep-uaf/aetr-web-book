    "text": "Data Sources\nData discussed in this report come from 2 main sources… (Are there any other data sources?)\n\nEnergy Information Authority (EIA)\nwhat is this? Why isn’t a source for all data? (i.e. reporting to EIA is not required for Alaskan utilities) - list of forms? which ones actually used? - how did Neil get these\n\n\nPower Cost Equalization\n\nQ: what is this program? why utilities report here? why is it fiscal year? why might data be missing?\n\nextracted from AEA “accounting system”\ncommunities vs utilities\n\nAssume no one knows what a PCE is. Maybe think of Catalyst while write this. Show what we have to offer and why Alaska is different/special.\nAlaska is famous for wide expanses of rugged terrain. Towns are often extremely distant from one another, or are separated by inaccessible mountains and glaciers. The utility landscape of Alaska resembles a sea of islands, very different from the interconnected grids of the contiguous United States.\nIn total, Alaska contains over 100 separate utilities, many of which serve a single small community. Most rely on diesel generators connected to huge fuel tanks, which receive a barge shipment of fuel in the summer that must last through the winter. If the town runs out of fuel during winter months, additional fuel has to be flown in at extreme expense. Predictably, electricity in these remote towns is prohibitively expensive. Some rural towns pay 3 to 5 times the rates of urban Alaska.\nUrban Alaska has greatly benefited from large state-subsidized energy projects, such as the Bradley Lake, Four Dam Pool, and the Alaska Intertie. Rural Alaska has not benefited from these programs. Therefore, in an effort to equalize differences between rural and urban Alaska, the Alaska Energy Authority administers the Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program, funded by earnings from an endowment fund, reimburses rural utilities for credits that have been provided to its customers. Eligibility is limited to residential customers and community facilities. The subsidy applies to the first 750 kWh per month of residential consumption. Community facilities are subsidized up to the first 70 kWh per month per person.\n\n\n\nWorkbooks (maybe call this something else)\nBy which I mean Neil’s cross referencing between the 2 sources - will we distribute these? If so, link. If not, then say why (nicely!) - how to cross reference between the AEA and EIA? This is cool! - differences between the 2 data sets",

Why didn’t we just copy that?\nPrevious iterations of the Energy Statistics Report used the Alaskan Energy Authority’s 11 regions. For yearly summary statistics, the 11 regions were very useful. However, with the multi-year scope of this Trends Report, we elected to condense the 11 AEA Energy Regions based on commonalities in geography and electrical profile.\nIn this report, we categorize the state into three separate energy regions, each being a collection of various Alaska Energy Authority (AEA) energy regions. These regions are herein known as the Coastal Region (Southeast, Kodiak, Chugach/Copper River), the Railbelt, and Rural Remote communities (all other AEA energy regions). For clarity, we refer to these three aggregated regions as the ACEP Energy Regions.\n\n\n\nRelationship between Energy Regions as defined by AEA and ACEP",
