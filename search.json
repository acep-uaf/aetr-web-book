Maybe think of Catalyst while write this. Show what we have to offer and why Alaska is different/special.\nAlaska is famous for wide expanses of rugged terrain. Towns are often extremely distant from one another, or are separated by inaccessible mountains and galciers. The utility landscape of Alaska resembles a sea of islands, very different from the interconnected grids of the contiguous United States.\nIn total, Alaska contains over 100 separate utilities, many of which serve a single small community. Most rely on diesel generators connected to huge fuel tanks, which recieve a barge shipment of fuel in the summer that must last through the winter. If the town runs out of fuel during winter months, additional fuel has to be flown in at extreme expense. Predictably, electricity in these remote towns is prohibitavely expensive. Some rural towns pay 3 to 5 times the rates of urban Alaska.\nUrban Alaska has greatly benefitted from large state-subsidized energy projects, such as the BradleyIn an effort to equalize differences between rural and urban Alaska, the Alaska Energy Authority administers the Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program, funded by earnings from an endowment fund, reimburses rural utilities for credits that have been provided to its customers. Eligability is limited to residential customers and community facilities, up to\n\n\n\nWorkbooks (maybe call this something else)\nBy which I mean Neil’s cross referencing between the 2 sources - will we distribute these?

However, with the multi-year scope of this Trends Report, we elected to condense the 11 AEA Energy Regions based on commonalities in geography and electrical profile.\nIn this report, we categorize the state into three separate energy regions, each being a collection of various Alaska Energy Authority (AEA) energy regions. These regions are herein known as the Coastal Region (Southeast, Kodiak, Chugach/Copper River), the Railbelt, and Rural Remote communities (all other AEA energy regions). For clarity, we refer to these three aggregated regions as the ACEP Energy Regions.\n\n\n\nRelationship between Energy Regions as defined by AEA and ACEP",
