    "text": "Generation capacity represents the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated at any given time dependent on certain conditions. The combination of generation sources is often referred to as the capacity mix. Changes in the capacity mix over time reflect decisions to build and retire generators. These decisions are a result of shifting costs, technological innovations, the normal aging of the generation fleet, and/or stakeholder policies. Due to data limitations, we show capacity levels for calendar years 2011-2013, 2018, and 2021. While we cannot observe year-to-year trends, there are enough years of data to visualize capacity trends from 2011 to 2021.\nWe begin this section by showcasing the increases in total capacity across the state. In 2011, it is estimated that the total statewide electricity generation capacity was 2.2 GW. We estimate that this has increased to approximately 3.16 GW in 2021 based on best available data. This represents an increase of 966.26 MW, or 44 percent. To illustrate this example, we show a stacked area chart below that showcases growth over time for various technologies.1\n\ncap_data = FileAttachment(\"data/working/capacity/capacity_long.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n\nPlot.plot({\n  // Configure the plot\n  title: \"Capacity changes, Statewide\",\n  insetLeft: 0,\n  insetRight: 0,\n  \n  // Configure the x-axis\n  x: {\n    tickFormat: \"d\",\n    label: \"Year\",\n    //domain: [2011,2012,2013,2018,2021]\n  },\n  // Configure the y-axis\n  y: {\n    grid: true,\n    label: \"Capacity (MW)\"\n  },\n\n  // Stacked area plot\n  marks: [\n    Plot.areaY(cap_data,\n      Plot.groupX(\n        {\n          y: \"sum\"\n        },\n        {\n          x: \"year\",\n          y: \"capacity\",\n          fill: \"prime_mover\",\n          order: [\"Fossil Turbines\", \"Recip Engines\", \"Hydro\", \"Wind\",\"Utility Solar\",\"Rooftop Solar\",\"Storage\",\"Landfill Gas\"],\n          tip: {format: {x: \"d\"}}\n        }\n      )\n    ),\n    Plot.ruleY([0])\n  ],\n  \n  // Configure the color scheme\n  color: {\n        domain: [\"Fossil Turbines\", \"Recip Engines\", \"Hydro\", \"Wind\",\"Utility Solar\",\"Rooftop Solar\",\"Storage\",\"Landfill Gas\"],\n        range: [\"#606571\", \"#9da7bf\", \"#00a1b7\", \"#F79646\", \"#fad900\",\"#9BBB59\",\"#71346a\",\"#896D09\"],\n        legend: true\n    }\n})",

    "text": "Historical Timeline of Prior Reports\n\n\n\nTimeline of Energy Reports\n\n\nStarting in 1969, the first electric power trends report was published by the Alaska Power Administration. During this time, the Alaska Power Administration was a federal agency housed within the U.S. Department of the Interior. Their first publication was known as the “First Annual Report” and covered data from the 1968 fiscal year. However, this became the “Alaska Electric Power Statistics Report” in 1971 and examined data from the 1960-1969 data years. The APA continued to produce intermittent reports until 1983 when the State of Alaska established the Alaska Power Authority (APA), which later became the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA).\nUnder state direction, the APA/AEA continued to publish intermittent reports on electric power statistics until their final publication in 1992 which covered data years 1960 to 1991. To address the reporting gap, the Alaska Systems Coordinating Council in collaboration with the State of Alaska, Department of Community and Regional Affairs, Division of Energy continued generating reports until 1996 with their final report covering data years 1960 to 1995. Finally, the University of Alaska Anchorage, Institute of Social and Economic Research produced several reports with their last covering 1960 to 2012. Since then, there have been no electric power statistical reports.\nThe following table provides a summary of this timeline. This report serves to supplement the reporting gap in electric power statistics for the State of Alaska.\n\nHistorical Timeline of Reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Published\nInstitution\nData Coverage\n\n\n\n\n1971 to 1983\nAlaska Power Administration\n1960 to 1982\n\n\n1984 to 1988\nAlaska Power Authority\n1960 to 1987\n\n\n1989 to 1992\nAlaska Energy Authority\n1960 to 1991\n\n\n1992 to 1996\nAlaska Systems Coordinating Council; State of Alaska\n1960 to 1995\n\n\n2003, 2011 to 2015\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage, Institute of Social and Economic Research\n1960 to 2012\n\n\n\n \nFor a full list of links to these described reports, please visit Historical Electric Power Reports.",

The first impetus for this report is a lack of combined reporting on electricity generation across the state that extends to federally and non-federally regulated electric utilities. The second impetus for this report is to aid in decision-making processes surrounding Alaska’s energy future.\nWith uncertainty in natural gas sources on the Railbelt, changing technology, and lower-cost alternatives, understanding trends in the state’s capacity, generation, consumption, and prices is vital to more informed decision-making.\nIn this report, we present data collected from federal, state, and local sources supplemented by correspondence with utilities. We show trends for capacity, generation, consumption, and prices. The capacity and generation trends include data from 2011 to 2021, and the consumption and prices trends are data limited to 2019. More information on sources and methods are provided in the subsequent sections throughout the report. This report uses data visualizations as the primary mode for presenting the trends. To accommodate this presentation style, we present trends as simplified regions of the state as opposed to the Alaska Energy Authority energy regions.\nWe emphasize that this report is designed to provide factual information to the best of our ability without providing recommendations or in-depth analysis. However, context is provided for more impactful trends.",

    "text": "This section outlines the trends in generation by fuel type for each region. Generation in our context has two separate definitions. Data collected through the Energy Information Administration (EIA) records “net” generation, which excludes electricity use for power plant operations. However, data collected from the Alaska Energy Authority’s (AEA) Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program is presented as “gross” generation, which does not make this exclusion.1\nThe following figure provides a visual representation of yearly electricity generation for the Coastal, Railbelt, and Rural Remote regions. All regions produced a relatively consistent amount of electricity between 2011 and 2021. Across this time period, the Railbelt generated an average of 4772 GWh, the Coastal region generated an average of 1131 GWh, and the Rural Remote region generated an average of 509 GWh. Between 2011 and 2021, the average yearly growth rate for generation was 1.62% in the Coastal region, -0.31% in the Railbelt region, and 2.43% in Rural Remote communities.2 The Coastal and Rural Remote trends are in line with improvements in rural electrification, as well as modest population growth. Of the regions, the Railbelt is the only one that consistently saw decreases in generation across the years.

    "text": "This section outlines the trends in generation by fuel type for each region. Generation in our context has two separate definitions. Data collected through the Energy Information Administration (EIA) records “net” generation, which excludes electricity use for power plant operations. However, data collected from the Alaska Energy Authority’s (AEA) Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program is presented as “gross” generation, which does not make this exclusion.1\nThe following figure provides a visual representation of yearly electricity generation for the Coastal, Railbelt, and Rural Remote regions. All regions produced a relatively consistent amount of electricity between 2011 and 2021. Across this time period, the Railbelt generated an average of 4772 GWh, the Coastal region generated an average of 1131 GWh, and the Rural Remote region generated an average of 509 GWh.

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nThe PCE data do show powerhouse consumption as a separate data item, which would allow for the computation of “net generation” in PCE communities. However, we have continued to report generation in PCE communities as the gross amount in order to be consistent with previous Alaska Energy Statistics Reports.↩︎\nCalculated with the compound average growth rate: \\(CAGR = \\left(\\left(\\frac{gen_{2021}}{gen_{2011}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2021-2011}} -1\\right)\\)↩︎\nOil consists of generators whose primary fuel source is diesel/distillate, naphtha, or jet fuel. Gas consists of natural or landfill gas. Hydro refers to conventional hydroelectric turbines. Wind and solar are both utility-scale (excluding behind-the-meter solar). Storage is not included in these calculations.↩︎\nNet generation from storage facilities are not included in these calculations.↩︎",
