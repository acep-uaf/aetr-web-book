    "text": "Generation capacity represents the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated at any given time dependent on certain conditions. The combination of generation sources is often referred to as the capacity mix. Changes in the capacity mix over time reflect decisions to build and retire generators. These decisions are a result of shifting costs, technological innovations, the normal aging of the generation fleet, and/or stakeholder policies. Due to data limitations, we show capacity levels for calendar years 2011-2013, 2018, and 2021. While we cannot observe year-to-year trends, there are enough years of data to visualize capacity trends from 2011 to 2021.\nWe begin this section by showcasing the increases in total capacity across the state. In 2011, it is estimated that the total statewide electricity generation capacity was 2.2 GW. We estimate that this has increased to approximately 3.16 GW in 2021 based on best available data. This represents an increase of 966.26 MW, or a 44 percent. To illustrate this example, we show a stacked area chart below that showcases growth over time for various technologies.1\n\nsw_cap = FileAttachment(\"data/statewide-total-capacity-by-year.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n\nPlot.plot({\n  // Configure the x-axis\n  x: {\n    tickFormat: \"\",\n    //type: \"band\",\n    label: \"Year\"\n  },\n  // Configure the y-axis\n  y: {\n    grid: true,\n    label: \"Capacity (MW)\"\n  },\n  // Configure the plot\n  title: \"Statewide, Capacity\",\n  insetLeft: 0,\n  insetRight: 0,\n  // Stacked area plot\n  marks: [\n    Plot.areaY(sw_cap, {x:\"year\",y:\"Capacity\", fill: \"Prime.Mover\", tip: \"x\"}),\n    Plot.ruleY([0])\n  ],\n  // Configure the color scheme\n  color: {\n        domain: [\"Fossil Turbine\", \"Recip Engines\", \"Hydro\", \"Wind\",\"Utility Solar\",\"Rooftop Solar\",\"Storage\",\"Landfill Gas\"],\n        range: [\"#606571\", \"#9da7bf\", \"#00a1b7\", \"#F79646\", \"#fad900\",\"#9BBB59\",\"#71346a\",\"#896D09\"],\n        legend: true\n    }\n})",

To provide an example of this, we show the variation in electricity prices for the residential customer class across regions and years in the figure below.\nDue to the wide range of electricity prices in Alaska, it is difficult to accurately summarize the data. Because of this, we determined that averages were best calculated using a customer account weighted average. Population is roughly correlated to price, with small communities experiencing higher rates than larger communities. The average number of customer accounts for the year was used to calculate the weighted arithmetic mean price for each year and region.\n\nregion_weighted_prices = tidy(weighted_prices, \n                              groupBy(['acep_energy_region', 'year'], [\n                                summarize({ mean_weighted_price: mean('weighted_price')})\n                              ]),\n                              filter((d) =&gt; d.year &lt; 2020))\n\n// plot of regional average prices\nPlot.plot({\n    x: {domain: [2011, 2019]},\n    x: {tickFormat: \"\"},\n\n    y: {domain: [0, 50]},\n\n    grid: true,\n    marginRight: 70,\n  \n    marks: [\n\n        Plot.line(region_weighted_prices,\n                    {x: \"year\", \n                    y: \"mean_weighted_price\",\n                    strokeWidth: 5,\n                    stroke: \"acep_energy_region\"\n                    }),\n\n        Plot.text(region_weighted_prices, \n            Plot.selectLast({x: \"year\", \n                                y: \"mean_weighted_price\", \n                                z: \"acep_energy_region\", \n                                text: \"acep_energy_region\", \n                                textAnchor: \"start\", dx: 5\n                                })),\n                                \n        Plot.tip(region_weighted_prices, \n            Plot.pointer({x: \"year\", y: \"mean_weighted_price\"}))\n\n\n    ],\n    color: {\n        domain: [\"Coastal\", \"Railbelt\", \"Rural Remote\"],\n        range: [\"#98BAD6\", \"#A4CD9A\", \"#E3918F\"]\n    }\n});",

The first impetus for this report is a lack of combined reporting on electricity generation across the state that extends to federally and non-federally regulated electric utilities. The second impetus for this report is to aid in decision-making processes surrounding Alaska’s energy future.\nWith uncertainty in natural gas sources on the Railbelt, changing technology, and lower-cost alternatives, understanding trends in the state’s capacity, generation, consumption, and prices is vital to more informed decision-making.\nIn this report, we present data collected from federal, state, and local sources supplemented by correspondence with utilities. We show trends for capacity, generation, consumption, and prices. The capacity and generation trends include data from 2011 to 2021, and the consumption and prices trends are data limited to 2019. More information on sources and methods are provided in the subsequent sections throughout the report. This report uses data visualizations as the primary mode for presenting the trends. To accommodate this presentation style, we present trends as simplified regions of the state as opposed to the Alaska Energy Authority energy regions.\nWe emphasize that this report is designed to provide factual information to the best of our ability without providing recommendations or in-depth analysis. However, context is provided for more impactful trends.",
