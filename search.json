    "text": "Generation capacity represents the maximum amount of electricity that can be generated at any given time dependent on certain conditions. The combination of generation sources is often referred to as the capacity mix. Changes in the capacity mix over time reflect decisions to build and retire generators. These decisions are a result of shifting costs, technological innovations, the normal aging of the generation fleet, and/or stakeholder policies. Due to data limitations, we show capacity levels for calendar years 2011-2013, 2018, and 2021. While we cannot observe year-to-year trends, there are enough years of data to visualize capacity trends from 2011 to 2021.\nWe begin this section by showcasing the increases in total capacity across the state. In 2011, it is estimated that the total statewide electricity generation capacity was 2.2 GW. We estimate that this has increased to approximately 3.16 GW in 2021 based on best available data. To illustrate this example, we show a stacked area chart below that showcases growth over time for various technologies.1\n\nsw_cap = FileAttachment(\"data/statewide-total-capacity-by-year.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n\nPlot.plot({\n  // Configure the x-axis\n  x: {\n    tickFormat: \"\",\n    type: \"band\",\n    label: \"Year\"\n  },\n  // Configure the y-axis\n  y: {\n    grid: true,\n    label: \"Capacity (MW)\"\n  },\n  // Configure the plot\n  title: \"Generation Capacity in Alaska\",\n  insetLeft: 0,\n  insetRight: 0,\n  color: {\n    legend: true,\n  },\n  // Stacked area plot\n  marks: [\n    Plot.areaY(sw_cap, {x:\"year\",y:\"Capacity\", fill: \"Prime Mover\", tip: \"x\"}),\n    Plot.ruleY([0])\n  ]\n})",

Why isn’t a source for all data? (i.e. reporting to EIA is not required for Alaskan utilities) - list of forms? which ones actually used? - how did Neil get these\n\n\nPower Cost Equalization\n\nQ: what is this program? why utilities report here? why is it fiscal year? why might data be missing?\n\nextracted from AEA “accounting system”\ncommunities vs utilities\n\nAssume no one knows what a PCE is. Maybe think of Catalyst while write this. Show what we have to offer and why Alaska is different/special.\nAlaska is famous for wide expanses of rugged terrain. Towns are often extremely distant from one another, or are separated by inaccessible mountains and glaciers. The utility landscape of Alaska resembles a sea of islands, very different from the interconnected grids of the contiguous United States.\nIn total, Alaska contains over 100 separate utilities, many of which serve a single small community. Most rely on diesel generators connected to huge fuel tanks, which receive a barge shipment of fuel in the summer that must last through the winter. If the town runs out of fuel during winter months, additional fuel has to be flown in at extreme expense. Predictably, electricity in these remote towns is prohibitively expensive. Some rural towns pay 3 to 5 times the rates of urban Alaska.\nUrban Alaska has greatly benefited from large state-subsidized energy projects, such as the Bradley Lake Hydroelectric Project, the Four Dam Pool Projects, and the Alaska Intertie. In an effort to confer similar benefits to rural Alaska, the state of Alaska developed the Power Cost Equalization Program (PCE); the Regulatory Commission of Alaska and the Alaska Energy Authority administer the PCE program. The PCE program reimburses rural utilities for credits that have been provided to eligible customers. Eligibility is limited to residential customers and community facilities. The subsidy applies to the first 750 kWh per month of residential consumption. Community facilities are subsidized up to the first 70 kWh per month per resident. Please visit the Alaska Energy Authority webpage for more information about the Power Cost Equalization program.\n\n\n\nWorkbooks (maybe call this something else)\nBy which I mean Neil’s cross referencing between the 2 sources - will we distribute these? If so, link. If not, then say why (nicely!) - how to cross reference between the AEA and EIA? This is cool! - differences between the 2 data sets",

However, with the multi-year scope of this Trends Report, we elected to condense the 11 AEA Energy Regions based on commonalities in geography and electrical profile.\nIn this report, we categorize the state into three separate energy regions, each being a collection of various Alaska Energy Authority (AEA) energy regions. These regions are herein known as the Coastal Region (Southeast, Kodiak, Chugach/Copper River), the Railbelt, and Rural Remote communities (all other AEA energy regions).

To provide an example of this, we show the variation in electricity prices for the residential customer class across regions and years in the figure below.\nDue to the wide range of electricity prices in Alaska, it is difficult to accurately summarize the data. Because of this, we determined that averages were best calculated using a customer account weighted average.

    "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nCapacity\n\nGeneration capacity on average increased across all of Alaska from 2011 to 2021.\nThe state saw large increases in renewable energy capacity, storage, and on-demand peaking units.\n\n\n\nGeneration\n\nNet generation has remained relatively stable\nThe Coastal region generated more power from wind and hydro, but less from oil in 2021 than in 2011.\nThe Railbelt region generated more power from wind, hydro, coal, and solar, but less from oil and gas in 2021 than in 2011.\nThe Rural Remote region generated more power from wind and solar, but less from oil and hydro in 2021 than in 2011.\nWe have seen significant increases in the usage of utility-scale battery storage.\n\n\n\nConsumption\n\nElectricity consumption has fallen for all customer classes, with residential customers seeing the most reductions.\nThe number of customer accounts have continued to increase throughout the state.\nPer capita consumption for the residential sector is highest in the Coastal region and lowest in the Rural Remote region.\n\n\n\nPrices\n\nResidential electricity rates increased on average across Alaska after adjusting for inflation, the PCE subsidy, and population weighting.\nThe region that experienced the least residential rate gain was the Coastal region with a 6% increase.\nThe region experiencing the highest residential rate gain was the Railbelt with a 26% increase.\nCommercial and Other customers in the Coastal and Rural Remote regions saw rate decreases where Commercial customers in the Railbelt region saw price increases of about 15%.\nPCE subsidies continue to dampen residential prices in the Coastal and Rural Remote regions.",
